# CHANGELOG.md

<a name="0.0.42"></a>

## 0.0.4

### Features

- Ionic / Angular app.

<a name="0.0.3"></a>

## 0.0.3 (until 2022-02-08)

### Features

- Full Auth flow: Sign up, Resend code, Forgot password, Sign in, Sign out.
- Moved from Amazon's AWS and Amplify to Google's GCP, because (a)
  Amplify is not mature enough and has too many bugs right now, (b)
  Amplify does not support Flutter-web and who knows when it will, (c)
  I have been stuck with Amplify for months just trying to get a user
  to sign in.
- Got responsiveness for switching between drawer being hidden behind
  a hamburger menu icon on small / mobile screens, and the drawer
  being split into a visible left column on larger screens
- Authenticator UI done
